### _Important: Certs should be used for development environments only_

To generate self-assigned SSL certificates signed by a VSA Root authority, visit [this repository](https://bitbucket.org/vsapartners/vsadev-ca-cert/src/master/).

If you’re using MAMP PRO, you can create self-signed certificates [within the app](http://documentation.mamp.info/en/MAMP-PRO-Mac/Settings/Hosts/SSL/). Windows users using WampServer [can try this](http://documentation.mamp.info/en/MAMP-PRO-Mac/Settings/Hosts/SSL/). Linux users — seriously, you probably already know this — but just in case, [here’s a refresher](https://prognotes.net/2016/07/install-local-lamp-stack-linux/) on setting up your LAMP stack locally, and here's the [SSL certificate instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04).

If you get stuck, Google is your friend. Happy coding!
